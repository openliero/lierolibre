methods:
* datapath.get_location_of(string) where string could be LIERO.EXE, LIERO.DAT,
  ...
  returning e.g. "/usr/lib/liero-data/LIERO.EXE"
  or "$HOME/.liero/LIERO.DAT"

datapath.get_configdir_location() returning "$HOME/.liero/"

Uses a plaintext file:

data file	writable
LIERO.EXE	0
LIERO.DAT	1

Assumes two locations: read-only data directory and writable $HOME/.liero/

All data files callable by glo start out in data dir

If a read-only file is requested return path to read-only

If a writable data file is requested and does not exist in writable,
it is copied from read-only dir to writable, and the writeable path is returned;
else returns path to writable (which exists)

gcl and glo (if data file is writable) creates $HOME/.liero if it does not exist

glo finds read-only dir and plaintext file from (pwd, cli argument,
/usr/lib/liero?, /usr/share/liero?)
