The binary linux release includes a lib/ directory with most of the libs needed
to run lierolibre, it is compiled with the relative path option to allow the
game to find these libraries.

With luck it will work in your case, if not, compiling from source is usually
more likely to produce a working result.

Source code and license texts for the libraries which require source code
and/or inclusion of license text are available in the libsrc/ directory.
