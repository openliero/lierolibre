LIERO for DOS HISTORY

	This history does not contain versions older than 1.0.

	Legend:
	* change
	+ addition
	- fixed bug
	! other stuff

Version 1.33
        * Ninja rope is traditional again!

Version 1.32
        + A documentation in English!!
        * Some progress with the CPU-player!! It acts very routinely, but
	  is still much better than random :)
        * Duds have been removed (too buggy)
        * Ninja rope:
          * Swinging is easier
          * Limited lenght

Version 1.31
        * Ninja rope is now more realistic!!
        * Gauss gun has been modified a bit
        * Dart has been modified
        * Moving backwards has been removed
        * The CPU-player is now _a bit_ more intelligent... it's not very
          smart, but better than the random-CPU. It doesn't care about the
          game type.
        - The names weren't saved; fixed
        - A couple of other bugs have been killed

Version 1.30
        + Gauss Gun
        + Duds: grenades etc. that don't explode
        * A new kind of ninja rope: it's thrown in the old fashioned way,
	  but the lenght can be adjusted
        * LIEROLOW.EXE has been removed... LIERO.EXE no longer required too
	  much memory
        - The SHADOWS ON/OFF-bugs have been fixed
        - Laser has been modified

Version 1.29
        * More realistic physics: the velocity of the worm is added to the
	  velocity of the projectile.
        * The worm backs up if you move backwards while shooting
        * Dart is now faster to reload
        + Booby trap has the name of the weapon it "contains" on it... this
          is what you've been waiting for
        + A new weapon: RB Rampage (Rubber Bullet)
        * LevEdit no longer has restrictions. The levels created with
	  earlier versions of LevEdit (<0.21) have to be "compiled" by
	  re-opening and saving. The new file format uses loads more drive
	  space, but makes it easier to expand in the future.

Version 1.28
        ! The memory requirements had increased even though this file told
	  the game needs 550kB... the real amount was 580kB and rarely anyone
	  has that much conventional memory free. Now a smaller LIEROLOW.EXE
	  without SFX is packed with the game, it requires 550kB.

Version 1.27
        - Bugfixes, bugfixes (when, oh when are 'em all eliminated..?)

Version 1.26
        - The worm no longer generates outside the level limits... finally!!
        - Small bugfixes

Version 1.25
        * Mini rockets is now more accurate
        * The worm no longer has to step on Booby trap, Mine etc., they
	  explode from a small distance
        - Bugfixes, e.g. Dart


Version 1.24
	+ A new weapon: Dart
        + A scrollbar has been added to the LEVEL and WEAPONS menus
        * There can't be two weapons of the same kind chosen in the WEAPONS
          menu except if there are less than five weapons to choose from
        * Blaster has been fixed: no longer explodes when hitting a worm
        * Grasshopper lasts longer
        * Medikits now heal by 10-50%
        * A modification to the CtF modes: now you have to take the flag to
          your home base
        * Changed the names of the game modes
        * Randomizing the names has been changed a bit...
        * The force used to throw objects (such as Grenade) is now
	  "adjustable". Read the HINTS section!!
        - The former settings did not load for the next game session
        - While loading the settings the colors of the worms weren't changed
	  right
        * When quitting the game the settings are always automatically saved
	  with the name LIERO, NOT replacing the settings in use

Version 1.23
        + A possibility to save the game settings to a file you want!!
	  That means you can create new game types by adjusting the loading
	  times, the availability of weapons, health etc.
          Packed with the Game comes an example configuration: TAGFLAG.
	  Try it!!

Version 1.22
        - The health meter crashed if health was 10000%

Version 1.21
        - No longer crashes in heavy use!! It has been tested: 2
	  random-CPU-worms, both with heavy weapons, loading times 0%,
	  99 bonuses, map on, amount of blood 500%, shadows on, health
	  10000%, 999 lives. And the game ran easily 5 hours with these
	  settings...
	  Unstability was caused by a very simple bug.

Version 1.20
        * Missile turns slower (easier to control)
        * The bullets of Rifle and Winchester are faster
        * The laser sighting has been removed from Winchester
        * More animation
        + LOAD+CHANGE-option. When this setting is ON, you can change weapons
	  while loading.
        + The WEAPONS menu:
          + You no longer have to choose the same weapons over and over again
          + Randomize, which randomizes the weapons
            A hint: if you don't want to see the weapons you get, just press
            "FIRE" and then "Up"!!
        + PLAYER OPTIONS, where you can choose your name, amount of health,
	  the color of your worm and the keys too: KEYSETUP is history
        + A new game type: Flag + Tag
        + Game of Tag: the losing time can now be chosen
        + Capture the Flag: the flags needed to win can now be chosen
        + The mines are now the same color as the terrain (harder to notice)
        - The worm sometimes appeared outside the level (_rarely_)
        - A huge pile of bugfixes

Version 1.19
        + Capture the Flag!!
        + Frameskip, makes the game run faster
        * When you're killed, you can no longer appear next to the other
	  worm or to the place you were killed at
        * Fixed the Missile controls
        - Bugfixes...

Version 1.18
        * The Missile controls have been fixed -> easier to direct
        * You can now use other weapons while reloading!! You still have to
	  have the weapon chosen for reloading it.
        * Larpa explodes when hitting a worm
        * Radioactives have been removed (too efficient)
        * The worm may also regenerate in the sand, creating a fitting hole
        + A new weapon: Grasshopper
        + You may now choose the availability of the weapons (Menu, Bonuses
          Banned)!!
        * Game of Tag:
          * The timer of "it" no longer runs while the other worm is dead
          * A suicide makes you "it"
          - The timer no longer crashes at 10 minutes
        - Bazooka, Doomsday and Mini Rockets acted in a weird way when they
	  were blocked by Fan (didn't actually bother)
        - The worm can no longer get stuck on stones!!
