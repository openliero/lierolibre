* Decide on SND CHR blobs
* Flickering menu selection
* Scale2x
* LIERO.DAT -> liero_settings.cfg
* Don't use SND format
  + Enable more sounds
* Don't use CHR format
* Don't use NAMES.DAT file
* Unify naming liero.cfg, lierocfg.txt, liero.lng, preferebly.txt ending
* At least try to build on all arches
* Compile the linux binary releases statically to the extent possible, trying
  to ship 50 shared libs with it seems both painful and unreliable...
