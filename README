lierolibre is an old-school earthworm action game. It is a direct fork of Liero
(OpenLiero).

Features:
  * 2 worms, 40 weapons, great playability, two game modes: Kill'em All
    and Game of Tag, plus AI-players without true intelligence!
  * Dat nostalgia
  * Extensions via a hidden F1 menu
    + Replays
    + Game controller support
    + Powerlevel palettes
  * Ability to write game variables to plain text files
  * Ability to load game variables from both EXE and plain text files
  * New freely licensed audio
  * Scripts to extract and repack graphics, sounds and levels

To switch between different window sizes, use F6, F7 and F8, to switch to
fullscreen, use F5 or Alt+Enter.

The file 'data/liero.cfg' is a plain text file containing all the game
variables, this file is intented to be modified, go wild! Some things are
likely to not work (make the game refuse to start, or crash) though:
  ! Appending/Deleting elements
  ! Changing integers to strings, strings to integers, etc.
  ! Changing the sine and cosine tables
